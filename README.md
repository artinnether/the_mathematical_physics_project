## Repository Notes

This is a static GitHub Pages site. Main files:

- `index.html`: public landing page and resource library.
- `papers/`: topic landing pages for selected PDFs.
- `sitemap.xml`: search engine discovery map.
- `robots.txt`: search engine crawl instructions.
- `PROMOTION.md`: reusable launch and sharing checklist for new PDFs.
- `tools/papers.json`: bilingual article metadata, cover images, and available PDF editions.
- `tools/generate_topic_pages.py`: generator for shareable paper pages and sitemap entries.
- `tools/paper_thumbnails.json`: source PDF, page, crop coordinates, and language for each featured figure.
- `tools/extract_paper_thumbnails.py`: reproduces the original PDF crops in `assets/` (requires `pdfplumber` and `Pillow`). Run `python3 tools/extract_paper_thumbnails.py` from the repository root.

When adding a publication, include it in both Latest and the full library, and add every language variant to `resourceDates` in `index.html`. The Book heads the full material library; the remaining materials run from oldest to newest. Latest publications and the separate exercises section keep their own ordering. Featured images use `data-src-es` / `data-src-en` and translated alt text; use a shared crop only when it has no language-specific prose. Gauge and Klein-Gordon notes have no illustrations, so their thumbnails reproduce equations from the PDFs. The thumbnail manifest records the exact selection for every card.

## Contact

Use the contact form on the website or the social links in the footer.

Library topics: keep each card’s broad `data-category` and add space-separated `data-topics` for more specific filters (`gauge`, `operator-algebras`, `lie-algebras`). Show matching bilingual pills on the card and provide a bilingual filter button for each topic. Search indexes Spanish and English titles, descriptions, and labels regardless of the selected display language.
